This chess game project has taken inspiration from various sources and combined with my creative input. As it stands, it offers a platform for two players to engage in a game of chess, showcasing the fundamental chessboard and piece placement.

However, the project is currently in progress and requires the implementation of piece movements to bring the game to its full functionality. I am open to collaboration and further development to complete the game and make it an engaging and feature-rich chess experience.

In summary, this chess game is a work in progress, blending inspiration and personal creativity, and I'm open to collaboration for its completion, particularly in coding the moves for each chess piece.
